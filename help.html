            <h2>This field is Turing-complete.</h2>
            <p>There's a tractor in a field, driven by a farmer.</p>
            <p>You can write instructions for the farmer in the field.</p>
            <p>When the tractor reaches an instruction, the farmer follows it.</p>
            <p>The tractor has a trailer where it carries a stack of bales of hay.</p>
            <p>The bales of hay represent numbers.</p>
            <p>The farmer can do arithmetic with bales of hay.</p>
            <p>When the tractor drives over a number, they put a bale of hay representing that number on the top of the trailer.</p>
            <p>When the tractor drives over an arithmetic instruction, they take two bales of hay off the top of the stack, producing a new bale of hay, and put that back on the top.</p>
            <p>When the tractor drives over an "if" instruction, they take a bale of hay off the top of the stack. If it's a zero, they go one way, otherwise they go in the opposite direction.</p>
